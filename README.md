## Description

We were assigned to create a random password generate where a user can select certain criterium including how many characters they wanted it to be (had to be between 8-128), and if they wanted to include any of the following:
<ul>
<li>Upper case letters</li>
<li>lower case letters</li>
<li>special characters</li>
<li>numbers</li>
</ul>

## Installation

## Credits

I received help from a tutor, Juan Delgado, who helped me write the conditional statements to validate user selections. He also showed me how to create an empty string and then use "+=" to add to it. 

I also received help from TA, Jen Doyle, who recommended I switch my earlier variables from strings to arrays.
